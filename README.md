## Description

The goal of the project is to detect if the context of the same word is different or the same in seperate senteces in Slovenian language. 
The Corpus will be taken from Gigafida http://eng.slovenscina.eu/korpusi/gigafida or Training Corpus http://eng.slovenscina.eu/tehnologije/ucni-korpus from where we will extract sentces which contain preselected words. We will intentionally chose words with multiple meanings (ambigious words).
